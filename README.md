This solution tackles football (soccer) analysis using computer vision techniques! It employs object detection to pinpoint players, the ball, referees, and goalkeepers within video frames. By leveraging Agglomerative clustering, the system differentiates teams based on the colour of their jerseys. Finally, it calculates the vanishing point to identify potential offside positions, providing valuable insights for automated analysis and decision support.
